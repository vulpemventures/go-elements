Go support for confidential transactions on Elements-based blockchains

**The package is currently being developed.** For stable versions, you must refer to the [latest release](https://github.com/vulpemventures/go-elements/releases)

## Install

```sh
# Install latest tagged release
$ go get github.com/vulpemventures/go-elements@latest
```

## 👀 Examples

- [Broadcast blinded transaction - with unblinded input](pset/pset_test.go#L335)
- [Broadcast blinded transaction - with blinded input](pset/pset_test.go#L490)
- [Broadcast issuance transaction - with unblinded inputs, unblinded issuance, blinded outputs](pset/pset_test.go#L689)
- [Broadcast issuance transaction - with unblinded inputs, blinded issuance, blinded outputs](pset/pset_test.go#L867)

## 🖥 Development

* Clone repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/vulpemventures/go-elements.git
```

* Enter into the project folder and install dependencies:

```sh
$ cd go-elements
$ go get -t -v ./...
```

* Run tests

> For running tests it is required to have a running [Nigiri](https://github.com/vulpemventures/nigiri) locally, or at least a remote one reachable from the outside.  
 To run the tests it is mandatory to export an `API_URL` environment variable pointing to the URL of `nigiri-chopsticks`.

```
$ nigiri start --liquid
$ make test
```

* More detailed documentation

```
$ godoc -http ":8080"
```
